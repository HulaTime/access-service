# Access Service
A basic access and authentication service I'm building. This is currently a WIP with a significant refactor in progress and mostly just some basic crud functionality that probably isn't working properly atm.

dotenv file currently committed with dev values, this would not be included in a production environment

## Planned features
- Accounts creation and self serve sign up
- Access token exchange via username and password
- OAuth support
- Flexible policy generation, application and verification
- Refresh token flows
- M2M flows
